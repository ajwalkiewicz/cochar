        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>
          <kbd>cochar</kbd> is a python package for generating random characters
          for Call of Cthulhu role playing game 7th edition. This website is a
          demonstration of its power.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The origin of this project starts in 2019, when I started to learn
          Python programming language. It begun as a side project to learn
          Python fundamentals. The best about programming is that you can create
          things that you need by your own. As a game master I needed to create
          characters during a game. I couldn't find any existing tool that would
          satisfy me. So I created one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time has passed and the project was growing. After putting a vast
          amount of work into it, I decided to share it with publicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please remember that this is a solo project. I'm trying to maintain it
          as professional as I can, but I'm not even a developer. With that
          having said I hope you enjoy it :)
        </p>
