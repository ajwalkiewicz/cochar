        <h3>Why generating characters is not historically accurate?</h3>
        <p>
          Historical accuracy, although it is very important it is not a main
          goal of Call of Cthulhu game neither this application. But the real
          reason is impossibility of providing such accuracy. That would require
          a huge amount of historical work to determine what was and what wasn't
          historically possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Call fo Cthulhu RPG is a game where players fun is more important than
          historical accuracy. Especially when we are talking about 1920's in
          the USA, with racisms and poor women rights (1920 - women right to
          vote).
        </p>
        <p>
          CoC RPG is also a game of imagination, therefore even though
          characters like 17 yo woman, doctor of medicine are completely
          historically inaccurate, it doesn't need to be interpret literally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, for those users that still feel a need for
          historical accuracy, generator provides a plenty of options that to
          some point allows to achieve it. User can choose an era, age, gender
          etc. to generate characters as much historically accurate as user
          wants it to be.
        </p>
        <h3>Is there an option to create completely random character?</h3>
        <p>
          As for now, not really. There are plans to introduce an option of
          creating a completely random character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, the best option to achieve it is to leave all fields empty
          and select occupation "random". That will allow to ignore all
          characteristics, and era options.
        </p>
        <h3>What does it mean: occupation (optimal)?</h3>
        <p>
          When real player are creating their characters for the game, they
          usually tends to maximize the amount of points that they can
          distribute among character's skills. To achieve that they usually
          choose occupation that suites best for the generated characteristics.
          The same thing can be achieve, when using alternative ways of creating
          a character. Player can choose first occupation and them try to fit
          characteristics that best suits it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "occupation (optimal)" allows to mimic such behavior. It means that
          the program choose an occupation that maximize the amount of skills
          points to distribute, based on prior generated main characteristics,
          such as strength, dexterity, education and appearance.
